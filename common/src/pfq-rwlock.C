// This file contains a simple implementation of a condition variable-based
// shared lock. The algorithm is described below.

// Linearization is handled via two bitfields, rin and rout, which govern the
// behavior and motion of readers through the lock. These are arranged as:
// - Bit 0: PHASE. Determines which wakeup signal waiting readers use.
// - Bit 1: WRITER. If 1, a writer has the lock or is waiting for it.
// - Remaining bits: TICKET. Unique identifier for a reader.
// It is assumed the number of readers will never go above 2^14 (16384)

// Incoming readers obtain a ticket by a fetch_add on rin, and if
// WRITER is set will immediately wait on a condition variable rcond.
// The associated mutex inlock maintains consistent access with the two wakeup
// booleans, rwakeup[2], and the choice of variable is determined by the
// PHASE bit of the obtained ticket.

// Outgoing readers indicate their disinterest by applying a fetch_add
// on rout, which gives them a a secondary "outgoing" ticket. If WRITER
// is set the non-atomic field last contains the ticket of the final reader.
// The final reader signals a condition variable wcond to wake up one of
// the writers that may be waiting. The normal mutex outlock and boolean wwakeup
// ensure no wakeups are lost on the writer side.

// Writers are serialized amonst each other via a single normal mutex wlock.
// All arriving writers choose a final reader via fetch_xor on rin, and
// check for present readers via fetch_xor on rout. If readers are present,
// it then waits for a wakeup via the condition variable wcond, resetting
// wwakeup after this has occured successfully. All of this is done while wlock
// is held, and wlock continues to be held through the critical section.

// Leaving writers first ensure outgoing readers will not attempt to
// (erroneously) wake up a writer via a fetch_xor (equiv. fetch_and)
// on rout, permit incoming readers via the same on rin, and then wake up
// any waiting readers via a notification on rcond.

// Inspired by the previous implementation, which was based on the following:
//   Bj√∂rn B. Brandenburg and James H. Anderson. 2010. Spin-based reader-writer
//   synchronization for multiprocessor real-time systems. Real-Time Systems
//   46(1):25-87 (September 2010).  http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11241-010-9097-2
// In addition to the above, the previous authors used a simplification where
// the readers span on a single shared atomic boolean. The version below
// replaces this with a condition variable, which is sufficient for the
// as the readers only serialize at the transitions between phases.
